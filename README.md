# Raspberry Pi DDNS Script
## rpi-ddns 

This PHP script is my own method for issue with Raspberry Pi server and variable ip address on the home internet.

If you share access to your Raspberry pi by TCP/UDP port and your IP address changes every now and then - this script is for you.

Of course there are many other methods (like "No-IP" or "DynDNS" services) but i like my easy way.

What do you need?
-----

- Raspberry PI or any other machine with Linux
- Enabled on your router TCP/UDP ports to your machine (be careful about this!). In my case it is port 80 - http. 
- Hosting with public address / domain
